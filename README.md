A comic & manga server in a single static Rust binary, drop-in compatible with [Komga](https://komga.org) — same API, same database.

*kmrs: Keep Manga Reading Simple.*

- **Drop-in replacement** for `gotson/komga`: same port (25600), same `/config` and `/data` mounts, same `KOMGA_*` environment variables
- **Data-level compatibility**: opens and upgrades existing komga data directories (`database.sqlite`, `tasks.sqlite`) in place — and the Java version can still open libraries written by kmrs
- **API parity**: REST `/api/**`, OPDS v1.2/v2, SSE, Kobo sync, and KOReader progress sync — endpoints, DTOs, pagination, error shapes, and authentication behavior match the Java version
- **Verified against the Java version**: byte-for-byte Flyway migrations, a differential test harness comparing ~105 endpoints against a live Java instance, and schema contract tests

## Quick start

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name=komga \
  --user 1000:1000 \
  -p 25600:25600 \
  --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/config,target=/config \
  --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/data,target=/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/kmworks/kmrs
```

The kmweb React web UI (built from [`webui/`](webui/) in this repo) is embedded in the binary and served at `/` out of the box — nothing to configure. Prebuilt binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows; x86_64 and aarch64) are on the [releases page](https://github.com/kmworks/kmrs/releases/latest); API-only clients like [KMReader](https://github.com/kmworks/kmreader), KOReader, or Kobo work too.
